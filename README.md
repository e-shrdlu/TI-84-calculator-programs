# TI-84-calculator-programs
my TI-84 calculator programs. `.8xp` is the file format you need to put onto the TI-84 calculator, but the human readable(ish) code is located in the `readable_code` directory

## individual explainations

### snake
there are various versions of snake programs, but they all suffer from an issue where the longer your snake gets the slower the game runs

### fake clear
displays a fake "memory cleared" message on the screen. Of course this is all just for fun and neither I nor anyone I know has ever used this to cheat on a test

### everything else
honestly I have no idea what half these are, it's been a while
